// HTML DOM methods are actions you can perform (on HTML Elements).

// HTML DOM properties are values (of HTML Elements) that you can set or change.



// The DOM Programming Interface
// The HTML DOM can be accessed with JavaScript (and with other programming languages).

// In the DOM, all HTML elements are defined as objects.

// The programming interface is the properties and methods of each object.

// A property is a value that you can get or set (like changing the content of an HTML element).

// A method is an action you can do (like add or deleting an HTML element).



// console.dir(document.getElementById("demo"));

const p = document.getElementById("demo");
p.innerHTML="TEST  BY DOM";
